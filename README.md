## 1. Data Cleaning with SQL: Employee Records Dataset

In this project, I undertook the challenge of cleaning a dataset related to employee records using SQL. The dataset, originally stored in a `.csv` format, contained various inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, incorrect data types, unnecessary spaces, and non-uniform naming conventions. Through a systematic approach, I applied multiple SQL techniques to transform the raw data into a clean, well-structured format ready for further analysis.

### Objectives

- **Data Cleaning:** Ensure the dataset is free from duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and erroneous data.
- **Data Transformation:** Standardize data types, convert date formats, and translate non-English text.
- **Data Structuring:** Organize the dataset by reordering columns, generating new attributes (like age and email), and removing irrelevant information.

### SQL Techniques Demonstrated

This project showcases proficiency in various SQL concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Data Manipulation:** Using `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `ALTER TABLE` statements to refine and correct data entries.
- **String Functions:** Applying functions like `TRIM`, `REPLACE`, and `CONCAT` to clean and format text data.
- **Date Functions:** Converting date formats and calculating age using functions like `DATE_FORMAT`, `STR_TO_DATE`, and `TIMESTAMPDIFF`.
- **Subqueries and Window Functions:** Leveraging subqueries and `ROW_NUMBER()` for duplicate removal and data validation.
- **Exporting Data:** Efficiently exporting the cleaned dataset into a new `.csv` file for further analysis or reporting.

### Files Available for Download

To better understand the data cleaning process, you can explore the following files:

1. **Original Dataset:** The raw dataset before any cleaning was performed. [Link to original `.csv` file]
2. **SQL Code:** The full SQL script used to clean the dataset. [Link to `.sql` file]
3. **Cleaned Dataset:** The final, cleaned version of the dataset. [Link to cleaned `.csv` file]

By working through this project, I demonstrated my ability to clean, transform, and structure data using SQL, ensuring that the final dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.
